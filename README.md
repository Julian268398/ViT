This repository contains code for an engineering thesis entitled ‘Improving lung cancer diagnosis through medical image analysis using Vision Transformers’. 
The engineering thesis focuses on improving lung cancer diagnostics using artificial intelligence and Vision Transformers technology. 
Its aim was to develop a model capable of analyzing computed tomography images to detect and classify lung tumors. 
Two models utilizing transfer learning and one model based on DICOM files were implemented. 
The transfer learning models achieved high effectiveness (up to 90%), while the DICOM-based model proved to be ineffective. 
The thesis highlights the potential of advanced AI technologies in medical diagnostics and proposes future directions for development in this field.
